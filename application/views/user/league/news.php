                Welcome back!
            </h5>

            As you can see, the website has been redesigned.  I'm using a new and better stat source that should allow for much more real-time and detailed updates for live scoring.
            I'm hoping the draft experience is much better, though I haven't had a whole lot of time to test it yet.<br>
            Please leave all comments about why we don't just use Yahoo to yourself.  Oh yeah, most importantly, I was able to completely migrate the league's historic stats which
            is probably the biggest reason.<br>
            <br>

            The draft has not scheduled yet, my first goal is getting everyone signed up, apparently you made it that far.
